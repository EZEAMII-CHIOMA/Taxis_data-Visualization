This project focuses on visualizing taxi-related data through various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations. The primary goal is to provide insights into the patterns, trends, and relationships present in the data.

Contents
The repository includes Jupyter Notebooks containing code and visualizations for:
2 Univariate Visualizations: Explore individual variables within the dataset.
2 Bivariate Visualizations: Investigate relationships between pairs of variables.
3 Multivariate Visualizations: Analyze interactions and patterns among multiple variables.

Data
The visualizations are based on a dataset related to taxi data, offering a rich source for understanding and interpreting the dynamics of this domain.
